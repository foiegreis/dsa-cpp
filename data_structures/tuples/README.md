# C++ Tuple

A tuple in C++ is a **fixed-size collection of heterogeneous elements**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>

std::tuple<int, double, std::string> myTuple(10, 3.14, "Hello");

// Accessing elements of a tuple
std::cout << "First element: " << std::get<0>(myTuple) << std::endl;
std::cout << "Second element: " << std::get<1>(myTuple) << std::endl;
std::cout << "Third element: " << std::get<2>(myTuple) << std::endl;
```

#### Functionality
- **Declaration**: Tuples are declared using the std::tuple template class, which allows combining multiple objects of different types.
- **Initialization**: Tuples can be initialized directly or through assignment.
- **Accessing Elements**: Elements in a tuple can be accessed using std::get<N>(tuple) where N is the index of the element.

#### Pros and Cons of Tuples
- **Pros**:

    - **Flexible Size**: Tuples can hold a variable number of elements, providing flexibility over pairs.
    - **Heterogeneous Elements**: Allows combining elements of different types into a single container.
- **Cons**:

    - **Index-Based Access**: Accessing elements requires knowing the index, which can lead to less readable code compared to named members in structs or classes.

#### Use Cases
Tuples are useful when you need to bundle together multiple values of different types into a single object, such as returning multiple values from a function or representing structured data.
