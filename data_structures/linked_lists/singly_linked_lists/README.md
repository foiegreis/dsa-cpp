# C++ Linked Lists

A linked list in C++ is a linear data structure where **elements are not stored at contiguous locations in memory**. 
Instead, each element (node) points to the next element by means of a pointer. 

```cpp
//std doesn't offer an implementation of Linked Lists. See the related cpp code in the folder
```

#### Functionality
- **Declaration**: Nodes of a linked list are typically defined using a structure (struct) or a class. Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node (Node* next).
- **Insertion**: Elements are inserted by creating new nodes and adjusting pointers.
- **Traversal**: Traversing the linked list involves iterating through nodes using pointers (Node*).
- **Deletion**: Elements can be removed by adjusting pointers and deleting nodes.
